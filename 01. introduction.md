# Introduction to Red Teaming 

**Red Teaming** is a **full-scope adversary simulation** designed to test how well an organisation can **detect, respond to, and recover from real cyber attacks**. In simple terms, it means **acting like a real attacker** and seeing how far you can go **before someone notices**.

It is not about breaking everything.
It is about answering one simple question:

> *If a real attacker targeted this company, would anyone catch them in time?*

If the answer is “no”, that’s the lesson.

---

## Formal Definition (CRTO-Relevant)

> **Red Teaming** is the process of using **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** to emulate a real-world threat, with the goal of measuring the effectiveness of **people, processes, and technology** used to defend an environment.


## Why Red Teaming Exists 🤔

Most companies already have:

* Firewalls 🔥
* EDR 🛡️
* SIEM dashboards with lots of green ticks ✅

Yet breaches still happen.

Why?

* Alerts fire, but no one looks
* Logs exist, but no one connects the dots
* Teams react too late

Red teaming tests **real behaviour**, not paperwork.

## Red Teaming vs Penetration Testing ⚔️

This is where many people get confused (and lose marks 😄).

| Pen Test        | Red Team           |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Find bugs       | Prove impact       |
| Scan everything | Pick one path      |
| Noise is fine   | Silence is gold 🤫 |
| Tool-heavy      | Decision-heavy     |


Real life lesson:

> A red team will happily ignore 50 bugs if one login gets them inside.


## How a Red Teamer Thinks 🕵️

A red teamer does NOT think:

* “What tool should I run?”

They think:

* “What would I do if this was my company to steal from?”
* “What gives me access with least noise?”

That’s why red teamers:

* Move slowly 🐢
* Touch fewer systems
* Avoid showing off tools

CRTO rewards this thinking.


## Red Team vs Real Attackers

Red teams **intentionally behave like real adversaries**:

* Use realistic attack paths
* Avoid noisy or unnecessary actions
* Maintain OPSEC
* Chain attacks logically

### Common Initial Access Methods

* Phishing (email, SMS, voice)
* Credential reuse
* Exploiting exposed services
* Physical access (badges, USB drops)

⚠️ **Important**
Red teams `do not use every exploit available.`
They use `what a real attacker would realistically use.`


## Objectives (Pay Attention Here 🚨)

### What an Objective Looks Like

An objective is `business-focused`, not hacker-focused.

❌ Bad:

* Get Domain Admin
* Own the DC

✅ Good:

* Access payroll data
* Reach finance systems
* Show ransomware impact
* Stay hidden for 3 days 👀

Domain Admin is often **helpful**, but it is not the prize.


## Why “Get Domain Admin” Is Not the Goal 😅

Real talk:

* You can steal data without DA
* You can deploy malware without DA
* You can cause panic without DA

Domain Admin is just a `key`, not the `treasure` 🗝️💰

CRTO wants you to understand this clearly.

## Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) – Easy Mode 🧩

Think of TTPs like this:

* **Tactic** → What I want to do
* **Technique** → How I plan to do it
* **Procedure** → Exact steps / tool

Simple. No magic.

## 1. Tactics – The “Why” 🎯

A tactic is the reason behind an action.

Common ones:

* Initial Access
* Privilege Escalation
* Credential Access
* Lateral Movement
* Persistence
* Command and Control

Attackers don’t jump randomly.
Each step helps the next one.

Example:

> Get higher privileges → steal creds → move to another system


## 2. Techniques – The “How” 🔧

A technique is the method.

For stealing credentials:

* Dump memory
* Read stored passwords
* Capture logins

Many roads lead to the same place.
Good red teamers pick the **quiet road** 🚶‍♂️


## 3. Procedures – The “Exact Steps” 📝

A procedure is how you actually do it.

Example:

* Dump creds using a famous tool ❌ (loud)
* Dump creds using built-in Windows tools ✅ (quiet)


Example: *LSASS Credential Dumping*

| Technique     | Procedure         |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| LSASS dumping | Mimikatz          |
| LSASS dumping | Task Manager dump |
| LSASS dumping | Procdump          |

Same result, very different noise.

Different procedures can achieve the **same technique**, but with **different detection risk**. Blue teams notice the loud one first 😉


## Visualising TTPs (Mental Map)

Think of TTPs as a **tree**:

* Objective (Root)

  * Tactic

    * Technique

      * Procedure

This helps you:

* Plan attacks logically
* Explain attacker behaviour
* Understand detection points

---

## Blue Teams (The Other Side 🛡️)

Blue teams are the people watching:

* Logs 📜
* Alerts 🚨
* Dashboards 👀

They might be:

* SOC analysts
* IT + security staff
* External providers

Red teaming checks:

* Do they notice?
* Do they understand?
* Do they react properly?

Finding gaps helps them improve.

## Where Attacks Usually Fail 😬

Most attacks fail because:

* Someone sees something weird
* An alert fires
* Behaviour looks odd

Not because exploits don’t work.

That’s why red teamers:

* Avoid noisy commands
* Use normal system behaviour
* Move only when needed


## Do Defenders Know About the Test? 🤷‍♂️

Sometimes:

* They know nothing
* They know “something” is happening
* They are watching closely

Red team behaviour should stay the same.

A real attacker doesn’t get a warning email 📧😄


## Common Beginner Mistakes 🚫

Seen again and again:

* Chasing Domain Admin for ego
* Running too many tools
* Making noise early
* Forgetting why they are attacking

Red teaming is about `control`, not speed.

---

## CRTO Exam Tip 🎓

Think in terms of:

* Why am I doing this?
* What does this give me next?
* How noisy is this?
* Does this help the objective?

If you think like this, tools become easy.

## Blind vs Informed Red Teaming

| Type       | Blue Team Awareness          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Blind      | No knowledge of exercise     |
| Semi-Blind | Knows an exercise may happen |
| Informed   | Fully aware                  |

CRTO typically assumes:

* **Detection-aware adversary**
* Focus on stealth and OPSEC

---

## Key Takeaways (Must Remember)

* Red teaming ≠ pentesting
* Objective is **business impact**
* TTPs = attacker behaviour model
* Privilege ≠ objective
* Detection and response are core goals
* Blue team effectiveness is being measured

## One Line to Remember 🧠

> Red teaming is about acting like a real attacker and showing real risk — not showing how many tools you know.
